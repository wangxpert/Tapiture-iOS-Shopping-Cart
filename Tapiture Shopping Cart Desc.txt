The “Tapiture iOS Shopping Cart” provides users with a seamless shopping experience within the Tapiture iOS application. Users now have the ability to select different options of a product (size, color, material, etc.) and add that product to a local shopping cart, and update or remove cart items.

Note: This application shows the ENTIRE user flow on it’s own (from waterfall -> product -> shopping cart -> checkout page).

The following is a list of the most important features implemented in “Tapiture iOS Shopping Cart”:
